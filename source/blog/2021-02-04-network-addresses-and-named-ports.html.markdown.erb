Network address and port information defines server service to listen on
which host and port.

READ_MORE

`go`’s `http` package provides `ListenAndServe` function. According to 
godoc:

> `func ListenAndServe(addr string, handler Handler) error`

`ListenAndServe` function accepts two arguments. The first one is `addr`
which is **host:port** definition. We can omit host information and
define network address as `":3000"`.

It’s possible to use named ports. On Linux/Mac all the network services
are defined under `/etc/services` file:

    #
    # Network services, Internet style
    #
    # WELL KNOWN PORT NUMBERS
    #
    rtmp              1/ddp    #Routing Table Maintenance Protocol
    tcpmux            1/udp     # TCP Port Service Multiplexer
    tcpmux            1/tcp     # TCP Port Service Multiplexer
    #                          Mark Lottor <MKL@nisc.sri.com>
    nbp               2/ddp    #Name Binding Protocol
    compressnet       2/udp     # Management Utility
    compressnet       2/tcp     # Management Utility
    compressnet       3/udp     # Compression Process
    compressnet       3/tcp     # Compression Process
    #                          Bernie Volz <VOLZ@PROCESS.COM>
    echo              4/ddp    #AppleTalk Echo Protocol
    #                 4/tcp    Unassigned
    #                 4/udp    Unassigned
    rje               5/udp     # Remote Job Entry
    rje               5/tcp     # Remote Job Entry
    #                          Jon Postel <postel@isi.edu>
    zip               6/ddp    #Zone Information Protocol
    #                 6/tcp    Unassigned
    #                 6/udp    Unassigned
    echo              7/udp     # Echo
    echo              7/tcp     # Echo
    #
    #
    http             80/udp     www www-http # World Wide Web HTTP
    http             80/tcp     www www-http # World Wide Web HTTP
    #

This list goes on and on... So, you can set `:http` as `addr` argument in `ListenAndServe`
function. Also you can use this convention almost everywhere! Enjoy named port
definitions.
