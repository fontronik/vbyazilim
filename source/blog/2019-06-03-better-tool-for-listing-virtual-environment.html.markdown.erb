I love `virtualenvwrapper`. You can manage your virtual environments such as
create/delete or list. Also you can kick additional variables on activation.

`virtualenvwrapper` stores environments under `~/.virtualenvs/`. When you ask
for listings of installed environments in your user environment, It basically
iterates over folder names under `~/.virtualenvs/` folder.

I currently have **24** folders, which means 24 virtual environments are
available. Let’s ask for list:

```bash
$ time lsvirtualenv

real    0m5.254s
user    0m3.627s
sys     0m1.241s
```

What was the operation ?

1. `cd` to `~/.virtualenvs/`
1. loop through folders and print their name

It took **5 seconds** on a **2,9 GHz Intel Core i7** MacBook Pro :) Don’t you
think It’s a bit too much ? I tried to implement same functionality via Bash
script:

```bash
$ time ls-virtual-env
real    0m0.514s
user    0m0.114s
sys     0m0.169s
```

It took almost half of a second. I wondered, If I can boost the speed up more!
Yes I can... I implemented the same functionality on **Golang** and added
extra features such as getting the Python version, coloring etc...

```bash
$ time lsvirtualenvs
real    0m0.066s
user    0m0.139s
sys     0m0.190s
```

Unbelievable! All done in mili-seconds. Most of the time consumed while
executing `python --version` command. You can download or inspect the
code on [GitHub](https://github.com/vigo/lsvirtualenvs)

You can install via;

```bash
$ go get -u github.com/vigo/lsvirtualenvs
```
